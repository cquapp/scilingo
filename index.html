Scilingo is an app prototype and is part of a research project at CQUniversity. It is designed to support CQUniversity nursing students’ learning of bioscience vocabulary for pathophysiology and pharmacology. This app is not intended for public use outside of its purposes for CQUniversity.

This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Scilingo when you download and use our mobile application (the "App") available on this Store. By using the App, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

Privacy Policy
Scilingo values and respects the privacy of the people we deal with. Scilingo is committed to
protecting your privacy and complying with the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) and other applicable privacy laws and regulations. 

This Privacy Policy (Policy) describes how we collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information, and how we maintain the quality and security of your personal information.

What is personal information?
“Personal information” means any information or opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. In general terms, this includes information or an opinion that personally identifies you either directly (e.g. your name) or indirectly.

What personal information do we collect?
The personal information we collect about you depends on the nature of your dealings with us or what you choose to share with us.
The personal information we collect about you may include:

Other information collected by the App may include:

•	Number of times the App is used, including dates accessed.

•	Proportion of correct and incorrect responses entered.


You do not have to provide us with your personal information, other than a valid CQUniversity student identification number. Where possible, we will give you the option to interact with us anonymously. However, if you choose to deal with us in this way or choose not to provide us with your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our services or otherwise interact with you.
If you choose not to provide a valid CQUniversity student identification number, we may not be able to provide you with our services or otherwise interact with you. The personal information listed above will only be used for research by individuals who have read the research project information form and signed the research participation consent form, which is located on the CQUniversity unit Moodle site. The App may still be used, even if consent for research participation is not given.

The App may also automatically collect certain information about your device, including your IP address, operating system, and device type. We may also collect information about how you use the App, such as the features you use and the pages you visit.
How do we collect your personal information?

Retention of personal information
We will not keep your personal information for longer than we need to. In most cases, this means that we will only retain your personal information for the duration of your relationship with us unless we are required to retain your personal information to comply with applicable laws, for example record-keeping obligations.

Scilingo will endeavour to keep your personal information accurate, complete and up to date.
